Tried to implement a Ramp Input response for PID tuning (kinda sorta barely works)
also added (and tested working):  
    -Software backlash correction
    -10 second acurator saturation shutdown (safety first)

example Ramp responses: http://imgur.com/a/ZEPAs
first pic is KP2 KD0 KI0.125
second is KP30 KD0.22 KI 16 (I use these for my System)
last une is KP3 KD0 KI64 (you can see the System is barely even stable and yeeeah i tried more than that xD)
